Description: Vulkan Loader Library
 Khronos official Vulkan ICD desktop loader for Linux The ICD loader is a
 library that is placed between a Vulkan application and any number of Vulkan
 drivers, in order to support multiple drivers and the instance-level
 functionality that works across these drivers. Additionally, the loader manages
 inserting Vulkan layer libraries, such as validation layers, between an
 application and the drivers.
